title: Which Are the Key Infrastructure Open Source Projects?

#### Project description
The study will analyze dependencies among open source projects
(e.g. specified in Maven or npm builds, or through FreeBSD
ports dependencies) in order to construct a graph.
This will the be analyzed, using e.g. the
[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)
algorithm, to determine which are the most important and critical projects.
Furthermore, the projects will be assessed in terms of risk they
pose to the community, based on characteristics such as
the number of committers,
licensing,
security handling,
product and process quality,
issue management, and
the freshness of commits.
