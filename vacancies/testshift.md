title: Vacancy (Testshift)

The TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group has the following vacancies: 

## PhD student & post-doc in Software Testing 

The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) has recently acquired a NWO Vici grant called [TestShift](https://testshiftproject.github.io/). The Vici grant is the most prestigious personal research grant from the Dutch Science Foundation NWO and will reinforce the software testing research line at Delft University of Technology. 

For this project we are seeking enthusiastic Master students interested in obtaining a PhD degree in the cross-section of software testing, human computer interaction, and socio-technical factors in software engineering. The prospective PhD student is expected to do high-quality research: coming up with creative solutions, working diligently to iron out all details and getting a deeper understanding, interacting with peers around the world, but also interacting with practitioners from both the open source and industrial domain to evaluate your research.

With software failures costing the economy USD 1.7 billion in 2017 alone, the goal of TestShift is to understand and radically change how software engineers consider their testing activities. Firstly, we want to understand their considerations, the trade-offs they make when deciding (not) to test (anymore). This complex matter is likely not the decision of an individual, but rather originating from a set of complex socio-technical circumstances. Secondly, with the help of very specialised test analytics TestShift aims to inform developers and development teams of their testing efforts and indicate potential shortfalls, with the aim of steering software developing organisations to test more effectively and efficiently.

TestShift is rooted in empirical software engineering and will make use of research methods such as ethnography, longitudinal field studies and case studies.

### Job requirements

- A Master's degree (or equivalent) in computer science
- A strong interest in software testing, empirical research, and socio-technical factors
- Strong programming and software engineering skills
- Good communication and presentation skills in English
- Ability to work in an international team
- A healthy dose of _creativeness_

### How to apply? 
Create an application package containing:
- A detailed CV (with contact information for 2 references; sending references letters yourself is not necessary)
- A letter of motivation that includes at least 10 lines of text containing your vision of the TestShift project (e.g., what do you consider to be an urgent topic to address, how would you go about the project, etc.) --> a generic letter of motivation is not appreciated. Your letter of motivation is perhaps the most critical part of your application package; I will be looking for a healthy dose of creativity. For example, give your vision on the socio-technical aspect of software testing, or provide a view on how test analytics can be helpful and what needs to be investigated to bring this vision to the market.
- A (draft) version of your Master thesis
- Optional: (draft) versions of papers that you have submitted/published 
- A detailed transcript of university grades
- Proof of English proficiency

Send your complete application package to Andy Zaidman (a.e.zaidman@tudelft.nl).

### About the research environment

The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) is part of the department of Software Technology, faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and a member of the research school IPA. The group employs approximately 30 people, comprising full, associate, and assistant professors, lecturers, postdocs, and PhD students. The main research areas for the group include but are not limited to software analytics, software testing, software quality and maintenance, software evolution and search-based software engineering. The involved researchers have developed numerous techniques to make it easier for software developers to (1) understand, (2) maintain and (3) test existing software systems. More information about the group can be found here: [https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl)

SERG is part of the Department of Software Technology (ST), which comprises research groups working on core computer science and engineering topics. The department is responsible for a large part of the curriculum of the BSc and MSc programmes in Computer Science as well as the MSc programme in Embedded Systems. The department’s research mission is to perform excellent research at an internationally-recognised level in the design, construction and analysis of complex, concurrent and cooperative computer and information systems. Inspiration for the research topics is derived largely from technical ICT problems in industry and society. The Department moved into new office and lab space in 2018.

The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) is known worldwide for its high academic quality and the social relevance of its research programmes. The faculty’s excellent facilities accentuate its international position in teaching and research. Within this interdisciplinary and international setting the faculty employs more than 1100 employees, including about 400 graduate students and 4000 undergraduate students. Together they work on a broad range of technical innovations in the fields of sustainable energy, telecommunications, microelectronics, embedded systems, computer and software engineering, artificial intelligence, interactive multimedia and applied mathematics.

Located in a charming college town, TU Delft is the largest and oldest public technological university in the Netherlands. The university is regularly ranked among the most highly-rated worldwide for engineering and technology.
