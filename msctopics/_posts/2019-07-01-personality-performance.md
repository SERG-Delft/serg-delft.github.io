#### Project description

People think, feel, behave in different ways. Some people stay calm in most situations while others get angry easily. These differences in actions and behavior is a reflection of people's personality. But have you ever wondered, **how developer personality influences software development?**

Our work is in finding data-driven evidence that can help understand the social-side of software development. As a part of your masterâ€™s thesis, you will be solving a part of this problem but also learning data science.
