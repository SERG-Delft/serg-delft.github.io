#### Project description

Fowler defines **refactoring** as 
_"the process of changing a software system in such a way that does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure"_. 
Over the years, empirical studies have established a positive correlation between refactoring operations and code quality metrics, indicating that refactoring should be regarded as a first-class concern of software developers. 

However, deciding when and what (as well as understanding why) to refactor have long posed a challenge 
to developers.
After all, 
developers refactor code for many different reasons. 
The task of identifying relevant refactoring opportunities, 
which currently heavily relies on developers' expertise and intuition, 
**should be supported by sophisticated recommendation algorithms**. 

In this project, you will research on different methods to recommend
code improvements to developers. For this, you might make use of:

* AI (search-based) techniques
* Machine Learning/Deep Learning/NLP techniques
