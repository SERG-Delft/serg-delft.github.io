#### Project description

ING features an extensive A/B testing pipeline, that they use to run various
experiments with, mostly for their web applications. ING is interested
to improve the A/B testing pipeline and also to extend it to traditional
applications (e.g., mobile or desktop).

Potential project ideas:

- **Analyzing the existing state:** Why do some teams make extensive use of A/B
  testing while others shy away? What are the organizational hurdles that need
  to be removed? How can we define success for an A/B experiment? How can we
  statistically test the cummulative effect of multiple A/B experiments?

- **Tooling for A/B testing at the release pipeline:** How can we build an
  effiecient A/B testing pipeline for traditional applications? What are the
  implications of using A/B testing feature toggles on the code?
