#### Project description

The *[awk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK)*
programming language [1] simplifies the processing of field-separated
text files by specifying a predicate to select the lines to operate on
and an action to perform on them.
With suitable restrictions and specialized support on the actions
(mainly on operations with global variables) *awk*-like programs can be
executed in parallel, following the
[MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) [2] paradigm
by splitting the input into multiple chunks,
running each chunk on a separate CPU core or node cluster, and then
combining the results with a suitable *reduce* operation.
The award-winning *DTrace* dynamic analysis tool [3] follows a similar
design to satisfy different requirements.
The objectives of this project are

* to design this language based on an examination of real-life awk programs,
* to implement the system in a modern systems programming language, such as Rust or Go, and
* to benchmark its performance over the classical version of awk.
