#### Background

The analysis behind the adoption of a software library is a critical and complex process 
that requires specific attention in: 1) the correctly understanding of the problems 
on which decisions must be made, 2) finding and using the best knowledge available, 
3) taking into account the perspectives of all involved stakeholders, 4) identifying 
the factors that influence the decision-making, 5) identifying information sources 
and potential tools to facilitate the decision-making process, 6) determining the 
impact and consequences of the decisions, and 7) documenting and disseminating 
the decision-making experience.

#### Problem

The success of software reuse relies on the outcomes of a decision-making process 
regarding the selection of which libraries to adopt. However, despite software 
re-use in the form of software libraries being a central part of modern software 
development, we do not know the circumstances, the thought process and the evaluated 
factors that lead practitioners to adopt a certain library over others or to adopt 
a library instead of re-implementing functionality.

In practice, software practitioners use ad-hoc methods to decide which libraries to 
adopt. The lack of a systematic approach may let software developers to be influenced 
by their emotions and cognitive biases while making decisions, a well-known phenomenon 
in decision-making [2]. Research has been showing that developers indeed take different 
factors into consideration when evaluating a library, such as how much they trust it [6], 
or how popular the library is in its ecosystem [3],[4],[5].

#### Research Questions:

*	How software practitioners choose a software library?
*	What influences the decision-making of software libraries adoption?
*	Which are the most appropriate quantitative methods/techniques for the evaluation of software libraries?
*	Which quantitative and qualitative factors influence the decision-making (assessment and evaluation) of software libraries adoption?
*	How can quantitative factor-based analysis improve the decision-making of libraries adoption? 
*	How practitioners implement decisions related to the adoption of libraries (put into practice)?

#### Project’s context

[Codefeedr](http://codefeedr.org) [1] is a joint project between Software Improvement 
Group (SIG) and the Department of Software Technology (ST) at TU Delft. Our main goal 
is to make software analytics a core feedback loop for software engineering projects. 
In this context, the master thesis project aims to: (1) develop a near real-time tool 
to tackle current challenges in the decision-making of libraries adoption, and (2) 
to evaluate it in a real setting at SIG. SIG’s expertise in software quality provides 
an excellent environment to conduct research and to interact with real settings in 
decision-making. The decision support tool will provide a comprehensive and up-to-date 
view of the appropriate conditions to support software practitioners with the decision-making 
of software libraries adoption.
