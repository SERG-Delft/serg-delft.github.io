#### Project description
**Are their biases in software development? How to find them?** 

If these are some questions that you are interested in answering, join us. Our work is in finding data-driven evidence that can help understand the social-side of software development. As a part of your masterâ€™s thesis, you will be solving a part of this problem but also learning data science.
