title: Improving ING's Machine Learning as a Service
---

#### Project description

Machine learning is a very imprortant feature for several ING products. For
this reason, ING is investing in Machine Learning as a Service, an internal
team to make ML a generally available feature for all interested ING teams.
There are various ways that the ING's MLaaS can improve, some topics of
interested are listed below:

- **Combining live and historical data in ML models:** How can we perform
  analytics operations that combine live and historical data in an efficient
  way? How can we live-retrain ML models when the current model fails with
  current live data.  A potentially interesting approach would be to use TU
  Delft's [Codefeedr](http://codefeedr.org) project for this reason.

- **Monitoring ML models:** Data provided as inputs to ML models can change, as
  a result of new services being deployed or due to temporal effects. How can we
  effectively monitor that the currently deployed ML model is suitable for the
  data it processes?

- **ML pipeline deployments:** How can we efficiently train, test-deploy and
  really deploy ML models? How can we A/B test ML models? How can we collect
  analytics and trace data for currently deployed models? The purpose of this
  task is to remove the human factor from deploying and monitoring ML pipelines.
