Welcome to the new (academic) year!

In this first SERG seminar of the year we will be sharing updates and have space for general discussion.

If you have anything you'd like to share or announce, you can add it to the slide deck ☀️ (shared on Mattermost).


In the later part of the meeting we'll also be co-creating the schedule for the SERG seminar of the coming months.
