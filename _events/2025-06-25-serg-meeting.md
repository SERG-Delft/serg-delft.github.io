In this edition of our weekly SERG seminar we will have two speakers:

**Ali Asgari**,  *Empirical Software Engineering for Testing* : I will discuss how empirical methods have been used to evaluate quality attributes in software systems, drawing on insights from my paper, “From Testing to Evaluation of NLP and LLM Systems.” I will also focus specifically on robustness testing, highlighting key findings from our recent work, “Metamorphic Testing of Deep Code Models: A Systematic Literature Review.”

**You?** 
The second spot is still free! If you have a complimentary (not too similar) topic you'd like to present in our seminar, please poke Caro!

If you are interested to give a 15 min + 10 talk or host a 25 min discussion session in one of our next meetings, please contact Carolin Brandt via Mattermost or email.
