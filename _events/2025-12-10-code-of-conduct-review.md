Whoever is interested can join us to read, discuss and comment on the new Code of Conduct Draft for the TU Delft.


For about a year the new Code of Conduct has been in development.
After several rounds of feedback with the integrity team and sounding boards, now a complete draft is shared with the TU Delft community (employees and students) for public comments.

You can find the draft version here: https://www.tudelft.nl/en/community/social-safety/code-of-conduct
(likely we will discuss the english version within SERG)

[Survey to send in comments (to the teams writing the code of conduct)](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=TVJuCSlpMECM04q0LeCIe3mDEMsgPvRPiUETUr0OmcJUMU5HM0ROU0lMQTM3TTFWQ0IyVkFWR0M0SCQlQCN0PWcu)

If there is interest, Caro can also share some more about the process until this draft, and why a new code of conduct is written.
