[Before the PhD defense of Joseph Hejderup](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/events/2024/05/21/PhD-Defense-Joseph-Hedjerup/), we will host a seminar on software supply chains featuring four area experts and a panel discussion. This seminar aims to explore cutting-edge trends, challenges, and research in the analysis, security, and management of software supply chains.
