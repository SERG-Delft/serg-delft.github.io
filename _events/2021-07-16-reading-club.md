In the last session
we looked at how Machine Learning is being used in Software
Engineering (specifically, to predict flakiness of tests). In this
session, we explore the opposite perspective ie. how is Software
Engineering different for ML systems compared to traditional software?
The paper for discussion is "[Software Engineering Challenges of Deep
Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8498185)".
