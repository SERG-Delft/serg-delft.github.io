Dear all,

Join us on December the 12th, 14:00 - 15:00 on Zoom for the next **SERG Reading Club** 📖📚!
We're reading the paper *Nix: A Safe and Policy-Free System for Software Deployment* to learn
about reproducible software deployments.

Nix is a package manager for Linux/Mac that gained a lot of popularity in the last years and
is based on the work of former SERG-Professor Eelco Visser!

You can find the paper on [usenix.org](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/lisa04/tech/dolstra.html)

See you there 👋🏼😄
