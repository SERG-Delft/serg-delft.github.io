**Abstract:**

In this talk I will go over how we can use Emacs (the mighty text
editor) and org-mode (markdown's big brother) to craft a research
workflow. We will look at how we can leverage the power of Emacs and
org-mode to capture, store, search and retrieve research data, all in
plain text! The talk will also touch upon how org-mode can be used as
an environment for literate programming and reproducible research. I
do not assume any prior knowledge of Emacs or org-mode so most of the
content will be newbie friendly. If you are a seasoned emacs user, you
should still participate! I go over my personal workflows and custom
org-extensions that I have written which might be interesting to you
(or do it just to support a fellow colleage!). To those who do not see
themselves using emacs ever, I have a segment on my philosophy of
using plain text to manage research data, perhaps that will be of
interest to you. To fellow vim users I say: come to the dark side.
