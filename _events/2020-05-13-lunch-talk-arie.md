The Delta-Maintainability Model (DMM) offers a methodology for assessing the way an individual commit affects the maintainability of a system.
In a nutshell, the DMM measures the proportion of _low-risk change_ in a commit. The resulting value ranges from 0.0 (all changes are risky) to 1.0 (all changes are low risk). It rewards making methods better, and penalizes making things worse.

Recently, we implemented a simple version of the DMM as part of [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller), the open source git repository mining tool.

In this talk, we walk through the Delta-Maintainability Model, discuss the implementation choices made, offer a comparison with the (more robust) DMM implementation provided by SIG, and explore its application to a number of open source systems.

This is based on joint work with Marco di Biase and Magiel Bruntink from the [Software Improvement Group](https://www.softwareimprovementgroup.com/).
