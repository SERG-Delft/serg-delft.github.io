Hello Everyone,

I will be presenting my ongoing research this Thursday (11th June, 15:30 hours) as part of my Go/No-Go meeting. I will talk about key challenges in integration of software and security from developer's perspective. I will also cover the work done during the first year of my phd and future research plan. Please feel free to join to provide your valuable feedback. The audio/video conferencing details will be shared later.

Regards,
Vivek Arora
