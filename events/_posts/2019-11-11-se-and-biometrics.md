Sharanya Konandur, Jón Briem, and Pavel Rapoport (all SERG MSc students) 
will discuss how SE researchers have been using biometrics in their
experiments.

More specifically:

* Sharanya will talk about the different parts of the brain (more specifically, the ones we can measure with our EEG) and what they mean.
* Pavel will talk about the different experimental designs he has found in the literature.
* Jón talks about the different tasks researchers give to participants.
