Abstract

[LIBTwinSVM](https://github.com/mir-am/LIBTwinSVM) is a free and open-source library for Twin Support Vector Machines (TSVMs). It has quite a number of useful features such as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application, a Python Application Programming Interface (API), a feature-rich visualization tool, and fast TSVMs estimators. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the [LIBTwinSVM](https://github.com/mir-am/LIBTwinSVM) library in terms of classification performance and computational time.

The contents of this talk are as follows:
- Reviewing the basic idea of SVM and TSVM.
- Introducing the LIBTwinSVM library and its main features
- Design and implementation of the LIBTwinSVM library.
- Benchmarks
- Solved and open problems in the project.
